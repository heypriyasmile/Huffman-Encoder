# Huffman-Encoder
The "CBHuffman" project on GitHub is focused on implementing the Huffman coding algorithm, a popular method for lossless data compression. The repository includes several JavaScript files, such as huffman.js for the Huffman coding logic, heap.js possibly for managing the heap data structure used in the algorithm, and front-end components.
